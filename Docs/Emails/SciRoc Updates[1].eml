Dear Team Leaders,

Registration to the first ERL Smart CIty RObotic Challenge (the SciRoc chal=
lenge) is now officially closed and I am glad to confirm that your team has =
been accepted to compete in the challenge, which comprises five episodes, to=
gether with other  14 teams.

The event, which is the first of its kind, promises to be extremely excitin=
g and I would like to thank you again for supporting it.

In earlier emails, we asked you to give us information about your team, you=
r platform and your involvement in the competition. If you already gave us a=
ll the necessary information, we will get in touch in the next few days aski=
ng you to check that the information  we have about your team and your plans=
 for the competition is still correct. If you have not sent us all the relev=
ant information, we will send you shortly a form to complete. You will also =
be asked to provide us with a team logo (for the competition website)  and c=
ompile a safety check list for your robots, as well as a Photograph & Video =
Release Form.

Since we need to schedule the competition for fifteen teams over five episo=
des, your co-operation in this matter is very important and we will ask you =
to reply promptly to our email, either confirming or providing the necessary=
 information about your team.

Earlier, we announced a financial support of up to =C2=A31000 for each particip=
ating team. This will allow each team to ask for a refund for their accommod=
ation, travel and other relevant expenses up to the designated amount. We wi=
ll provide you with the relevant  form and details of the reimbursement proc=
edure soon.=20

As far as accommodation is concerned, we recommend that you stay in Central=
 Milton Keynes (CMK), where the competition will take place.  A particular c=
heap option in the area is EasyHotel, which provides single rooms from =C2=A319.=
99 per night. There are also  plenty of apartments that can be rented in CMK=
, which may overall provide a cheaper alternative to hotels, especially for =
larger teams. We will publish a list of accommodation options shortly on our=
 website.=20

Finally, we will also provide you soon with details about where to ship rob=
ots prior to the competition.

For those of you interest in taking part in Episode 4, we did a small modif=
ication of the rulebook:
In the description of Phase 2 (Section 6.1), the part of the rule specifyin=
g the behaviour of the robot in the elevator has been modified with the foll=
owing sentence:
"There will be always a person in the elevator when the robot has to get ou=
t."
This means that the robot can assume there will always be a person in the e=
levator at the floor it has to exit.

This is all for now. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have queri=
es about any aspect of the competition, whether to do with technical element=
s or logistics.

See you soon in MK!
